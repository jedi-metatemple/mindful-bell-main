This file presents the mathematics for the advanced random distribution that I believe to be ideal for a mindfulness bell.

The mathematical notation system used here is not the traditional one, but an alternate one that I designed to be far more ASCII-friendly. More on this notation system in the file "math-notation.txt".

DEFINITIONS:

ch[0]
The seconds from the epoque that the program is started (and when the first chime is invited).

ch[n]
With 'n' being a hypothetical positive integer, this expression refers to the number of seconds from the epoque that any subsequent invitation of the chime occurs.

m
Defined as shorthand for 'n-1'.

gp[0]
The goalpost set at the start of the program's run

gp[n]
The goalpost set at the n'th round of the program's run.

ch[n:a]
The minimum possible value for 'ch[n]'

ch[n:z]
The maximum possible value for 'ch[n]'

ch[n:s]
The difference between the minimum and maximum values for ch[n]. (In these randomness equasions, 'a', 'z', and 's' are not defined variables, but as modes.)

avg
The target-average number of seconds between chime invitations.

min
The minimum number of seconds between chime invitations.

buf
An integer who's minimum value is '1'. The greater it's value, the more subtle the effect any wait-period between bells has on the random distribution of the next wait-period.

rnd:[x]
For 'x' is any positive integer - this is a randomization function
